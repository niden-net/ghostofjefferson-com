I'm a retired executive and consultant.  My wife and I have lived up on the mountain outside of Harpers Ferry since 2002.  We have six cats.  

It would be nice if we could all agree on everything, but lately we can't seem to agree on anything.  So for what it's worth, I will be offering my opinions in this space as often as time permits.  

You can contact me at <a href="mailto:editor@ghostofjefferson.com">editor@ghostofjefferson.com</a>.

Update - I've been appointed by the committee to fill the vacancy in the 67th.  I'll be on the ballot this November as a candidate for the WV House of Delegates.
