I'm going to take the liberty this week to split this column in two as there are a couple of items of note that I would like to bring to your attention.  The first one is all good.  The second - not so much.  

The first concerns the forum last week co-hosted by the Eastern Panhandle Business Association and the West Virginia Business and Industry Council that took place in the Skyline Ballroom of the Hollywood Casino and Charles Town Races.  I attended and by any measure it was a success.  It brought together business people, office holders and various leaders from around the state to convene with their local counterparts.  The Skyline Ballroom was full - with more than 175 attendees - an excellent turnout.  

In his opening remarks, EPBA Chair Jim Ruland said that "we may all be witness to history" commenting, "I can't recall when we have ever had both the Senate President and the Speaker of the House here together in our panhandle", adding that Eastern Panhandle resident, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R - Jefferson) was also in attendance.  

Morrisey was the first keynote speaker at the event and had some interesting things to say.  For example, he is proud of the reforms he has instituted since taking office.  Two of those have realized $18 million in revenue for the state and $4 million in savings.  Morrisey also said that there would be no million dollar expenditures by his office during an election year as has occurred in the past, also stressing that while engaging with agencies to enforce the state's laws, the state should be "both fair and reasonable".   Said Morrisey, "There is no friends and family plan in the state of West Virginia's AG office - and there never will be again." 

Keynote Speaker, Speaker of the House Tim Armstead (R-Kanawha), addressed four major areas of legislative focus: 

- Tax Reform
- Legal Reform
- Education, and
- Regulatory Reform.  

The final keynote speaker Bill Cole (R-Mercer) - the president of the state senate - while acknowledging that he is in campaign mode (he's running for governor), stated that compromise is a good thing.  Hmmm.  

After that less than auspicious start, Cole recovered by channeling both Ronald Reagan and Thomas Jefferson.  He offered what might have been the quote of the day: "I'm from Charleston and I'm here to help", which elicited laughter from the audience.  He continued, "I'm so happy that things are going so well in the Eastern Panhandle that I look forward to you continuing to send your tax dollars to us so that we can spend them anyway we please.  Thank you very much".  He then added, "You've probably heard that speech before, so I'm here to offer you something different".  

Subsequently channeling Thomas Jefferson, Cole said that "the government that is closest to the people, serves the people best".  Stressing that regional and local solutions are needed in West Virginia, Cole said that our state government is too centralized - that Charleston is too controlling.  He said that it's easier to hold local government officials accountable.  

That serves as the perfect segue way into the second part of this two-part missive, as last week the Jefferson County Commission - that government that is closest to us here in Jefferson County -  voted to hold a special election to decide whether or not to assess an excess levy.  The excess levy is an additional tax assessed against property owners that gets sent to Charleston - a portion of which is then remitted back to the local school board.  

In order for the excess levy to be assessed against property owners it must be approved by the voters.  On August 13th, in a special session, the Jefferson County Commission voted 3 to 2 to approve a special election to be held later this year on December 12th.  Those voting in favor were Jane Tabb, Patsy Noland and Dale Manuel.  Those voting in opposition were Walt Pellish and Eric Bell.  There was no opportunity for public comment prior to the vote and the County Commission only allowed one speaker.   

According to my sources, the reason for the special election is that if the measure fails in December, the levy issue would be placed on the ballot in May 2016 during the primary election and they would get a second shot at it if need be.  Imagine that - it is viewed by its supporters as an insurance policy.  The cost of the special election is around $80,000.  The county school board is also prepared to double down and spend another $80,000 to promote it.  So this so-called insurance policy will cost the taxpayer upwards of $160,000. 

Let me repeat that, $160,000 of taxpayer money for an election that need not happen.  Commissioner Walt Pellish who, by the way, supports the excess levy, commented that he could not go along with spending $80,000 for something that would be placed on the May ballot as a matter of course.  Eric Bell agreed with Pellish and said that the $80,000 would be better spent replacing the leaking roof at Jefferson High School.   

There are those that believe (myself included), that the County Commission made a serious breach of trust with the public by not providing for public commentary prior to the vote.  Further, the cost of the election and promotion campaign is coming out of the School Board budget.  You can't make this stuff up!  

For my part - in my mind's eye - I have removed the "R" after Commissioner Jane Tabb's name.  She has demonstrated, at least to me that she is a Republican in name only.  I would humbly suggest that the next time she runs for public office, she do so as a Democrat or some other party.  She has demonstrated (at least to me) that she cares not for the taxpayer - nor for fiscal responsibility.  

In the past, I have voted for the excess levy, but this latest stunt has given me pause.  It is the height of arrogance and disregard for the public to spend upwards of $160,000 unnecessarily without even giving the public the respect to elicit input on the matter, especially since the $160,000 comes out of the local school board budget.  Perhaps the voting public should teach these folks a lesson.  What an outrage.
