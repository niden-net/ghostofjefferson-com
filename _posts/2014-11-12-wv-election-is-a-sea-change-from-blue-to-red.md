The dust has finally settled on the 2014 elections. I'm going to take this opportunity to offer some random observations, thoughts and musings as to what transpired on November 4. It was indeed an historic day here in West Virginia with what State Chamber of Commerce President Steve Roberts described as "a game changing election". 

Game changing might be an understatement. I've noted before that a sea change is underway in West Virginia, but the tsunami that hit our state caught everyone, myself included, by surprise. In 2012 Republicans picked up 11 seats in the House of Delegates. They added another seat in 2013 when Delegate Ryan Ferns switched party affiliations narrowing the gap to 53-47. There were many who anticipated that the Republicans could make further inroads this year, but no one expected an increase of 17 seats. Republicans now hold the house for the first time since 1930 and by a margin of 64-36. 

If that weren't surprising enough, Republicans gained 7 seven seats in the State Senate pulling even with the Democrats at 17-17, surpassing even the most optimistic projections of party hopefuls. Then on November 5th, the day after the election, Senator Daniel Hall switched parties giving the Republicans an 18-16 majority. They now hold a majority in both houses. 

Hall began his career as a Republican. Upon losing his initial Delegate race in 2006 he changed parties and won in 2008 as a Democrat. He won his current Senate seat in 2012. Hall's case is not unique. There are several current members of the House of Delegates that lost initially as Republicans that had to switch party affiliations in order to win. Now that trend appears to have reversed. In fact, Evan Jenkins switched parties from Democrat to Republican to run against long time Congressman Nick Rahall, a Democrat, and won. My how things have changed. 

Sticking with the national scene, much has been made of Alex Mooney's move from Maryland to West Virginia to run for the US House of Representatives - the seat formerly held by Senator elect Shelley Moore Capito. Ironically, Capito was successful in her bid to replace retiring Senator Jay Rockefeller - who moved to West Virginia from New York. He also originally ran as a Republican and lost, switched parties and then won. 

I've heard some folks say that Mooney is an opportunist. Opportunity is actually a wonderful and positive thing. Like many good and positive things, it takes on a negative connotation when we turn it into an "ism". I suspect that many of the folks that criticize Mooney would have no trouble supporting Hillary Clinton when she runs for president. As Bill Clinton's presidency was winding down, instead of going back to Arkansas, she shopped around for the place she thought she had the best chance to win, settling on New York. To my mind, Mooney's move from Maryland to Jefferson County follows a path travelled by many of us who live here, including me. There are thousands that have migrated to Jefferson County and the Eastern Panhandle from Maryland in search of a better life. 

Meanwhile, here in Jefferson County two of our three Delegates are now Republican. Ironically, the darling the local NAACP, Tiffany Lawrence, was defeated by Jill Upson, who may very well be the first black Republican woman elected to the House of Delegates in West Virginia. You might recall that back in 2010, the local NAACP included Lawrence in a list of suggested candidates to be appointed to complete the term of Senator Robert Byrd. On the national level, GOP officials have called out the NAACP for not making mention of Mia Love, who won in Utah last week, and is the first black Republican woman elected to congress. Born in Brooklyn of Haitian immigrant parents, she will represent Utah's 4th district. For a bit of history, the first black woman to be elected to the legislature in West Virginia was Elizabeth Simpson Drewry in 1950. Drewry first entered politics as a Republican poll worker in 1921, and you guessed it, she switched parties and became a Democrat in 1936. You couldn't win in McDowell County unless you were a Democrat.

Getting back to the present, just after the election, the Spirit asked Delegate Stephen Skinner, who retained his seat in a squeaker over first time challenger Patricia Rucker, why the Republicans did so well. One of the factors he cited was "a lot of money". 

Historically, Republicans are outspent by Democrats in West Virginia by wide margin. The campaign finance reports available on the Secretary of State website only include activity through October 19. With regard to the candidates and their fundraising, Democrats were running ahead of Republicans nearly 2 to 1 up that point. That's pretty much par for the course. Democrat Coy Flowers running in Greenbrier County had raised over $160,000 - a mind boggling amount for delegate race. He didn't win. 

The "Honest West Virginians" Super Pac, financed by unions, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of Democrats. Trial lawyers are also big contributors to campaigns and the vast majority goes to Democrats. Republicans do not have equivalent resources and backing. So at the risk of stating the obvious, the Democrat losses translate into losses for unions and trial lawyers as well. 

Until human nature changes and voters attend campaign forums in droves, money will be a deciding factor in who wins elections. Maybe this election is an indication this is changing. I have my doubts, but hope springs eternal. In the meantime, the Republicans have been given a great opportunity. And opportunity is a good thing. We need more of it in West Virginia.
