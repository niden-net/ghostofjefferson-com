John Doyle’s Uber Mistake

The legislation that made share riding legal in West Virginia, [HB 4228](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=HB4228%20SUB%20ENR.htm&yr=2016&sesstype=RS&i=4228), was signed into law by then Governor Tomblin in March of 2016.  The law went into effect July 1st of that year.  Ride sharing services are provided by companies that have been classified as Transportation Network Companies. The two best known TNCs are Uber and Lyft.  In March of this year [Lyft went public](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/03/28/is-lyft-worth-19-billion/#6b842e2e6c63) and Uber is [planning to do the same](https://www.barrons.com/articles/uber-ipo-stock-price-51556285741) later this year.   

There was much fanfare and excitement surrounding the passage of the bill.  People could make money driving for Uber and Lyft and customers would have more choices. It was promoted as a “[boost to the state’s tourism industry and convention business](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/business/wv-senate-oks-uber-bill/article_ddd95f91-97f9-5ec0-ad7b-584d05756710.html)”.  Said then state Senator Chris Walters (R-Putnam) at the time, “one of the biggest complaints I hear is people not being able to get around, not being able to take taxis … from one area of Charleston to another to explore our city…”

The tourism industry is an important part of the economy in West Virginia, but especially in the Eastern Panhandle.  In Jefferson County, the industry provides more than one third of all jobs.  The lead sponsor of the bill was Daryl Cowles (R-Morgan), two of the co-sponsors were Paul Espinosa (R-Jefferson) and Jill Upson (R-Jefferson).  Stephen Skinner (D-Jefferson) voted for it and expressed his strong support for the bill to help cut down on drunk driving.  It passed the Senate unanimously and the house approved it 94-4.  So what’s not to like?  

The regulations contained in the legislation are different from neighboring states.  For example, it enforces different criteria for background checks than [Maryland](https://www.psc.state.md.us/wp-content/uploads/TNO-Brochure-for-website_07312018.pdf) or [Virginia](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/commercial/#tnc/screening.asp).  John Doyle, who currently serves in the West Virginia House of Delegates (D-Jefferson), at the time was a paid lobbyist for the taxi industry.  The taxi industry insisted that Uber and Lyft do the same background checks that are required of the taxi industry.  

Sounds fair enough. Right?  So why is this a big deal?  When a TNC does a background check on a prospective driver to become a “DC Partner” (a service area that includes Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia), they check for criminal convictions.  Felonies.  In West Virginia, the regulations not only include felonies, they also include misdemeanors.  That means that an applicant that would have qualified in Maryland or Virginia, does not qualify in West Virginia, with the result that more people are shut out of an opportunity to drive in West Virginia but it’s actually worse than that.  

For example, if you live in Jefferson County, and have a West Virginia license and tag, you can apply to Uber to be a DC or Maryland or Virginia Partner.  As a West Virginian, Maryland and Virginia welcome you (DC does not - by the way – but that’s a conversation for a different day).   Maryland and Virginia are open for business regarding your ride sharing service if you meet their standards.  You can picku anywhere, including the airports – Dulles, Reagan and BWI – which is why someone living West Virginia would do better to register for a service area outside their home state. (A couple years back Lyft changed their insurance rules to exclude policies written in WV.  That was a company decision and I don’t the reason or if that policy has since changed).  

Until recently, Uber considered the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia to be part of the Washington DC partner service area.  As a DC Partner you could make pickups in Harpers Ferry, Martinsburg and all points in between.  Last year, mid-year, that changed.  Suddenly, DC partners could no longer pick up in the Eastern Panhandle – even those with West Virginia tags.  An Uber representative, based in Charleston, told me that the company came to the realization that it felt that it was necessary to, in essence, wall in West Virginia, because of the misdemeanor issue.  

Why does this matter? West Virginia is not playing nice with its neighbors.  It isn’t reciprocating.  Furthermore, if you live in Harpers Ferry and you want to drive you would do better if you registered with Uber as a DC, Maryland or Virginia partner.  Pretty sad.  That way if you drive 10 minutes over the state line you could make pickups in Maryland and Virginia and at the airports where you could make more money. There is simply more business.  If you register as a West Virginia Partner if you take passengers from Shepherdstown to Dulles, you would have to come back empty without compensation for the return mileage. How ironic – John Doyle, who represents Shepherdstown in the legislature was instrumental in making this happen. 

HB 4228, created regulations with what might be considered “unintended consequences” if we want to be charitable about it.  But those who promulgate regulations seldom think things through and rarely understand their implications and ramifications.  This legislation erected a wall between West Virginia and neighboring states with regard to transportations services.  This is typical of our history – where[ prosperity has stopped at our borders](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/764833.Unleashing_Capitalism) because we put up insurmountable barriers to entry.  I suspect that the bill has created similar issues for cities like Huntington with its close proximity to neighboring Ohio.  But unless you know the background you would never know that ride sharing could work so much better for our state than it does.  

In the [Eastern Panhandle tourism](https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/tri_state/west_virginia/study-eastern-panhandle-leads-way-in-w-va-tourism/article_a7a892d4-d277-11e8-b06f-978349352a3b.html) is an important part of the economy.  In Jefferson County it is vital – even existential.  Ride share services could serve as an important stimulus.  However, regulation has forced Uber to cut us off from the Washington DC metropolitan area – which is the source a great deal of the customers for the local tourism industry.  Uber drivers should be able to bring passengers back and forth to and from our tourism destinations to Maryland and Virginia and Washington DC.  Instead a regulatory wall stands in the way.  

Charleston – please tear down this wall.
