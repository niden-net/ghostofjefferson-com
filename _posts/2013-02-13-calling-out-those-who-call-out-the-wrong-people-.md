"Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself" - Bo Diddley song title

I'm going to violate my guidelines in the writing of this column. Robert Snyder's column in last week's edition entitled Auntie Got My Gun requires a response. In it, he calls out defenders of the Second Amendment, which in and of itself is fine, but steps over a line when linking Jimmy Lee Dykes' actions - killing a school bus driver and taking a five year old boy hostage - to being a conservative and listening to Rush Limbaugh. Like listening to heavy metal music incites violence. 

As a counterpoint, the article also calls out National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre for calling for a study on video game violence invoking the First Amendment, freedom of expression. While I don't see why we need the study, I also don't see why a study is a threat to First Amendment rights. 

For the record, I don't listen to Rush Limbaugh's radio program. However, his program is popular and I know many good people who listen to it. To the best of my knowledge, these good folks haven't yet committed murder, nor do I think they are likely to. Regarding Jimmy Lee Dykes, if we assume that he was indeed a "conservative", did he commit murder because he listened to Rush Limbaugh? Really?

On the other hand, there is Christopher Dorner, the former LAPD policeman, charged with multiple murders, who is still at large. To the best of my knowledge, he is not a Rush Limbaugh fan. I would be willing to bet he isn't even a Republican. According to the Huffington Post, he is a big fan of CNN's Anderson Cooper and First Lady Michele Obama. 

Then there is the Family Research Council shooter, Floyd Lee Corkins II, convicted earlier this month of terrorism. In his testimony Corkins admitted that he targeted the FRC after discovering them using the so-called "hate map" provided by the "liberal" Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Here is a documented cause and effect - and in my humble opinion, the "hate group" is the SPLC. 

And who could forget union leader Jimmy Hoffa appearing on CNN last December after Michigan passed their right to work law. Said Hoffa: "This is just the first round of a battle that's going to divide this state. We're going to have a civil war." Mr. Snyder, this sounds like a Red Dawn militia scenario to me, and I think that it goes without saying the Mr. Hoffa isn't a conservative or a Republican. 

In the aftermath of the Fort Hood massacre, Michael Moore said something I agree with: "Blaming a whole group for the actions of just one of that group is anti-American". I don't often find common ground with Michael Moore, but it makes common sense that we should agree on fundamental principles. I also find common ground with Robert Snyder - regarding the First Amendment. 

There are many examples of attempts to abridge speech. In 1985 the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) was formed to combat obscene and violent lyrics in popular music. Rap and Heavy Metal were particularly targeted. There were congressional hearings. Witnesses testified that Heavy Metal was different from other forms of music in that it was "mean spirited" and that a central element of it was "hatred". Imagine that - Heavy Metal considered as a hate crime, three decades ago. By the way, the driving force behind the PMRC was Tipper Gore, former wife of Al Gore, who was not a conservative, nor a Republican. 

Finally, regarding the NRA, it is an advocacy group whose mission is to ensure that Second Amendment rights are respected and not infringed. It doesn't do as good a job as it could, particularly in the vetting of candidates. However, it is bipartisan, as it should be. Its recent endorsements include Senator Manchin, Governor Tomblin, State Senator Snyder, State Senator Unger and Delegate Lawrence. What do these folks have in common? They are all Democrats. Newly elected Delegate Paul Espinosa, a Republican has also been endorsed. In fact, there are few elected officials in all of West Virginia that have not received an A rating from the NRA.

While we are born with unalienable rights, those rights come with responsibilities. We have the right to free speech and freedom of expression but we must hold each other accountable for what we say and do. That is why I have written this particular column. Further, our freedom of speech does not infringe upon any other right. We have the right to own and bear arms. It is our moral duty to exercise that right responsibly. Ultimately it is our actions that speak louder than words.
