MoveOn, recently ran a contest. Soliciting submissions from the public they said, "Together with our friends at MAYDAY.US, we're working to produce a powerful, 30-second ad about the problem of money in politics". By the way, MAYDAY.US on its website discloses that it has raised more than $10.5 Million and describes itself as a "Super PAC to end all Super PACs". Just as World War I was described as the war to end all wars. It's an interesting turn of phrase and I suspect not an accidental one. 

MoveOn raises boatloads of money to influence elections. In a recent email to their members they warn, "It's the nightmare scenario...and right now, it's a likely scenario...if the worst does happen and Republicans sweep into power in the Senate..." I think you get the picture, they're a very partisan group. So while decrying the influence of money in politics, they and their partners raise tens of millions of dollars in order to influence politics. Right. 

According to the Washington Post in 2004, "Democratic 527 organizations have drawn support from some wealthy liberals...they include financier George Soros who gave $1.46 million to the MoveOn.org Voter Fund..." George Soros is 7th on the Forbes list of the wealthiest Americans with a fortune estimated at $23 Billion. He is also Chairman of Soros Fund Management, which began in 1969 as a hedge fund. Hedge funds make investments for institutions and the very wealthy. 

In 2010, Opensecrets.org, the website for the Center for Responsive Politics, which describes itself as "your nonpartisan guide to money's influence on U.S. elections and public policy" published an article called "Capital Rivals: Koch Brothers vs. George Soros". Of note, in the section entitled: Individual Contributions to 527 Organizations (2001-2010), it was George Soros: $32.5 Million, Koch Brothers: $1.5 Million. Included in that $32.5 Million was $2.5 Million to MoveOn. 

As aforementioned, MoveOn used to be known as a 527 group. According to Wikipedia, "MoveOn, like many other political organizations which sought to influence the 2004 election, was able to circumvent this legislation [referring to the McCain Feingold Campaign Finance Reform of 2002] using a 527 group". 527 groups are not limited as to how much money can raise, and the Citizens United decision lifted restrictions on their ability to campaign for or against federal political candidates. MoveOn quietly closed its 527 group in 2008.

Here in West Virginia, during this current election cycle there has emerged what is described by Opensecrets as a Liberal SuperPac. It's called "Honest West Virginians". I'll bet you've never heard of it, but according to the Charleston Gazette, "Honest West Virginians: The pro-Democrat committee run by labor interests raised about $645,600 last quarter and $896,100 altogether." It goes on to say, "Honest West Virginians has spent tens of thousands of dollars on TV ads against state Republican candidates, according to TV station political disclosures. Its ads have also shown up in newspapers and mailboxes, though no disclosures are filed with the secretary of state yet." By the way, State code (§3-8-2)requires that any PAC making independent expenditures or electioneering communications costing more than $1,000 must file reports immediately with the Secretary of State's office. 

Based on current disclosures it is impossible to accurately determine how much of this money is from out of state. One contribution of $250,000 is from the AFL-CIO listing a Charleston Address. However, in 2012 the number of union members in West Virginia actually declined by 9,000. With a declining membership here, where is the money coming from?

As of September 30th, "Honest West Virginians" has spent not "tens of thousands of dollars", but over $290,000, leaving it with $605,000 cash on hand. There are reports that more funds are rolling in. Brace yourself. 

So while you'll hear plenty about the finances of Republicans in the media, chances are you'll be hearing about the "Honest West Virginians" SuperPac for the first time here in this space. But you may soon be seeing their work. They've been causing a bit of a commotion in other parts of the state, but they appear to be headed this way. One of the races that "Honest West Virginians" has targeted is in the 63rd Delegate District in Berkeley County. I've seen one of their ads. It displays incumbent Mike Folk against a backdrop of the old "Looney Tunes" cartoons. It says "Our Delegate Mike Folk is Looney". Classy stuff. 

Historically, in West Virginia, Democrats have had the upper hand with regard to campaign finance - but this year the numbers are off the charts. When I think back to the last election cycle and the hackles raised regarding Eastern Panhandle Freedom Fund, I have to wonder why there is no similar outcry regarding the "Honest West Virginians" SuperPac. Normally, the AFL-CIO will run ads under its own name and PAC. Judging by the shameless content of these ads, perhaps they feel the need to hide behind the "Honest West Virginians" moniker. Doesn't sound so honest to me. 

MoveOn believes that money in politics is a problem, but maybe not so much if you're a Democrat. Apparently the same holds true for the so-called "Honest West Virginians" SuperPac as they spend their way across West Virginia unleashing attack ads against Republicans. To paraphrase an old colloquial expression, it appears that the Democrats think that their money doesn't stink.

In my humble opinion, the "Honest West Virginia" ad campaign comes across as desperate. I'm also concerned about the questions raised regarding state campaign finance disclosure laws. Time will tell on both counts.
